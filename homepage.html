				<h2>How do we want our communities run? throughOut of the Wreckage by George Monbiot</h2>
	We need a new political story
	In these videos George Monbiot outlines how we can democratise politics and economics, and transfer power back into the hands of the community.
	A toxic ideology of extreme competition and individualism has come to dominate our world. It misrepresents human nature, destroying hope and common purpose. Only a positive vision can replace it, a new story that re-engages people in politics and lights a path to a better future. In Out of the Wreckage (out now in paperback) George Monbiot shows how we can create a new “politics of belonging", radically reorganizing society from the bottom up, enabling us to take back control. In these videos he explains how we can create a new political narrative as well as democratise politics and economics, putting power back into the hands of communities.

	Neoliberalism is dead: we need a new political story
	Donald Trump understood the power of narrative: Clinton was the villain of his story, he was the hero; the hero of the story was going to restore order to the land. In order to reclaim political and economic power, WE need a new political narrative - a restoration story that will trigger the imagination and create a politics of belonging.

				<h3>New Dark Age Technology and the End of the Future by James Bridle</h3>
	As the world around us increases in technological complexity, our understanding of it diminishes. Underlying this trend is a single idea: the belief that our existence is understandable through computation, and more data is enough to help us build a better world.
	In reality, we are lost in a sea of information, increasingly divided by fundamentalism, simplistic narratives, conspiracy theories, and post-factual politics. Meanwhile, those in power use our lack of understanding to further their own interests. Despite the apparent accessibility of information, we’re living in a new Dark Age.
	From rogue financial systems to shopping algorithms, from artificial intelligence to state secrecy, we no longer understand how our world is governed or presented to us. The media is filled with unverifiable speculation, much of it generated by anonymous software, while companies dominate their employees through surveillance and the threat of automation.
	In his brilliant new work, leading artist and writer James Bridle surveys the history of art, technology, and information systems, and reveals the dark clouds that gather over our dreams of the digital sublime.
	In these videos James Bridle explains some of the arguments from New Dark Age.
