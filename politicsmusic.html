		Slavoj Žižek's new book, Like a Thief in Broad Daylight, examines the rapid changes to the world triggered by big-tech and the dangers and radical possibilities those transformations offer up.

		if Jeremy Corbyn's Labour project is an example of populism or whether Bernie Sanders could exist without Donald Trump.
