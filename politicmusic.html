		<p>Place public is born this Wednesday, November 7 with the publication of a "birth certificate" in the daily Libération and several newspapers of the regional press. 
		This "new political movement" is launched by a hundred people, gathered around the essayist Raphaël Glucksmann, the environmentalist activist Claire Nouvian, 
		engaged in the defense of the oceans, the Mayor of Kingersheim Jo Spiegel and the economist Thomas Porcher</p>

		<p>Slavoj Žižek's new book, Like a Thief in Broad Daylight, examines the rapid changes to the world triggered by big-tech and the dangers and radical possibilities those transformations offer up. 
		I went to meet him to discuss some lighthearted topics like the changing face of capitalism, why the liberal consensus has collapsed, whether we are truly free, 
		if Jeremy Corbyn's Labour project is an example of populism or whether Bernie Sanders could exist without Donald Trump.</p>

		David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - 
		and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. 
		The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018.
		
		Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 
		8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show "real terms" increases in prices.
